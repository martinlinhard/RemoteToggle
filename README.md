# RemoteToggle

# Setup

## General
This repository contains two things:
* A client (Android App)
* A server (Rust)

## Running the appliation

The server as well as the required exe (for muting) can be found in the releases.
You can start the server like so:
```bash
  .\"auth_server.exe" "{NAME_OF_YOUR_MIC}"
```
To determine the name of your mic you can simply start the SoundVolumeView.exe.

The android app needs to be build from source - to do that, you simply need to open the Client folder with Android Studio.
